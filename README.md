    - Front End Developer
    - FullStack Developer
    - Machine Learning Developer/Engineer
    - DevOps
    - MLOps
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:

   Currently my knowledge has progressed to the point of being able to write basic web applications, using a combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and Python.
   I can leverage API's to connect front end technologies to back end technologies through Python, but my backend knowledge is still lackluster. This is an area of weakness that needs working on.
   To this end I plan on completing Udemy courses on backend technologies such as MySQL, and others.

   Another gap in my knowledge as of now if I am not familiar with any Javascript technologies used in industry such as React, Node.js, among many others. I also don't know TypeScript.
   I should learn React through my coursework at CodeSpace, and I will use to my advancing knowledge of Javascript through the course to do additional self study on weekends as needed to cover the
   Javascript technologies being used in industry, as well as TypeScript itself.

   I am doing an AWS course currently on Udemy to become a certified solutions architect associate. My main motivation to complete this course is to immerse myself in the knowledge of how web technologies
   scale to meet the demands of millions of consumers without collapsing under the load. I also want to learn how to leverage these technologies for my own sake, be it in my professional career or be it within
   the scope of a future job.

   Finally, I want to familiarise myself with the underlying theory behind AI and machine learning before beginning to learn how to work with technologies like Pytorch and Tenserflow so create my own machine learning models.
   My drive to this end is how integral I believe AI will continue growing to be in our lives as time goes on, and like with cloud technologies, I want to learn how to leverage the power of this technology in my own life.
   I am passionate about it and I find it fascinating and incredible.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - Get my AWS certification by the end of June by studying for it 3 times a week, 2 hours a session.
    - Complete my MySQL course by the end of July by studying for it 2 times a week, 1 hour a time.
    - Complete my CodeSpace course with a distinction, by studying for it 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, resting on Sundays, and by submitting all my assignments early, as well as being an active member in the CodeSpace community.
    - Complete my Backend Masterclass course on Udemy by the end of August by doing it 1 hour a day 6 days a week, resting on Sundays, after completing my AWS and MySQL courses.
    - Get my first job as a FullStack Developer within 2 months of completing my CodeSpace course with a distinction, by applying to every applicable position I can find online and networking with people in the industry.
    - Self Study on weekends while employed to revise Calculus, Statistics, and Linear Algebra using Khan Academy for 4 hours a day, completing my revision by the end of November.
    - Complete the Standford University Machine learning coursework on Coursera, starting December, by the end of February, by studying on weekends, 4 hours a day.
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):

    - Have a salary of above R30,000 (3 year goal)
    - Have a salary of above R50,000 (5 year goal) 
    - Get employed in the Machine Learning industry (5 year goal) by leveraging my knowledge through self study and my work experience.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - My action plan consists of maintaining self discipline throughout the above
    - I will be going to bed at 22:00 and getting up at 6:00 every weekday in order to allow myself time throughout the day to achieve my goals
    - My partner will be my accountability buddy, who I will be reporting to daily in order to reflect as well as hold myself accountable for my actions.
    - I will maintain a healthy diet, as well as be gymming 3 times a week.
    - While sounding unrelated, there is a plethora of scientific literature on the mental health benefits and effects of a healthy diet combined with regular physical activity.
    - I will journal about my day before bed, reflecting on the highs and lows of the day, and documenting concepts I struggled with, this will aid in mental recall and accountability.
    - Limiting exposure to social media. I will not have any of the regular social media apps installed on my phone during my productive hours. This will limit distractions.
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Maintaining the routine described in my short term goals action plan will be crucial, all of those will carry into the success of my long term goals
    - I will recognise areas of weakness and adjust times and schedules as needed to accomodate myself. I will allow myself to spend extra hours on concepts that are difficult for the goal of achieving whole understanding.
    - Recognise a new technology or trend that might need to take priority over other goals in order to move forward in my career quicker.
    - When contributing to a larger group, seek insight and critique from experts and allow that to guide me. I will listen to those more experienced and abosrb whatever knowledge I can.
    - As above, always be willing to grow. I will network with professionals whenever the oppurtunity arrises, putting myself out there at community events and participating in larger discussions where I can.
   
### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Certain topics and concepts being more difficult to grasp than others, where these would disrupt linear progression, I need to allow this and find additonal resources to cover the concept. Through continued exposure to it through
      various different mediums or origins, I will be able to gain the understanding I need to progress, and I will allow myself this additional time for growth.
    - Remove the ego so often attached to failure, instead, I will use failure as oppurtunities for further growth, to learn and come back stronger, and not let them weigh me down.
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Channels offered to me through my work that allow me to upskill myself, I must jump on these.
    - Listening to the ones who have more experience very closely, reviewing their work and asking them what principles drove the decisions they made that I don't understand, in order to grow.
    - Continued contribution to open source, this will allow me to practice concepts I am learning on a continued basis
    - Side projects, develop them using work experience I have garnered and knowledge gained through self studied coursework.
    - Attending meetings or events that will hold a gathering of developers, these will provide networking oppurtunities.
    - Whenever available, seek the critique of my work by those that have more experience, and find out what I can do differently and why.
    - Going above and beyond at work, doing what is asked and then making myself available to contribute further wherever possible.
    - Maintaining active Github and LinkedIn profiles, these will with time lead to recruiters contacting me for new positions
    - Continued revision of all of the above on a month by month basis!
